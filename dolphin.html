<BR>The Ganges River dolphin, found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in India, is an intriguing mammal.
 Known as the "Susu," it's India's national aquatic animal. These creatures possess a long, slender snout 
and navigate murky waters using echolocation. Sadly, they face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and accidental entanglement
 in fishing gear, pushing them toward endangerment. Efforts by conservationists and local communities aim to protect 
their habitats and mitigate human-induced risks. As a vital part of the river's ecosystem and cultural significance, preserving these 
dolphins not only safeguards biodiversity but also reflects the commitment toward safeguarding our natural heritage.
